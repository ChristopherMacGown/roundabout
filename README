Roundabout is a mergebot which integrates Github and Hudson to test and disposition pull requests from forked
github repositories. Roundabout uses Hudson to build and test incoming code. If code passes the build/test,
an issue is created for a core team member to review the contributor's code. A core team member can approve
a merge of the incoming code by adding a comment containing 'LGTM' (Looks Good To Me) to the issue.
