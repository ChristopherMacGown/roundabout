Summary:

Roundabout is a mergebot which integrates Github and Hudson to test and disposition pull requests from Github forks.

 - Roundabout uses Hudson to build and test incoming code.
 - If code passes the build/test, an issue is created for a core team member to review the contributor's code.
 - A core team member can approve a merge of the incoming code by adding an 'LGTM' (Looks Good To Me) comment to the issue.

Required packages:

pyyaml
github2
lxml
